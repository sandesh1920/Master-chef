Ingredients you need
Hakka Noodles – Use any Indian brand of Hakka Noodles. I have used Ching’s Hakka Noodles. Note that these noodles is made with all-purpose flour so if you prefer a healthier version, then use whole wheat noodles or soba noodles (buckwheat noodles)
Veggies: You can add veggies of your choice. Mushroom give a meaty texture and umami flavor. If you do not like mushrooms you can skip them. You can choose from the following list of veggies:
cabbage (green or red)
carrots
french beans (green beans)
zucchini
broccoli
button mushrooms or cremini mushrooms
capsicum (bell pepper)
spring onions (scallions) or regular onions
Soy sauce: Try to use naturally fermented soy sauce as it gives a lovely fermented taste and flavor to the noodles. You can even use bragg liquid aminos or tamari instead.
Toasted sesame oil – The noodles get a lovely hint of smokiness from toasted sesame oil. But do not worry if you do not have toasted sesame oil. Just use any other neutral tasting oil like sunflower oil or safflower oil.
Herbs and spices: Garlic, dry red chillies, celery or coriander leaves (cilantro) are the herbs and spices added. Celery is not available everywhere in India. So if you do not have celery, then just skip it. Use green chillies instead of dry red chillies.
Rice vinegar: Instead of rice vinegar you can add white vinegar or apple cider vinegar. You can even use rice wine or mirin. Both rice vinegar and rice wine give a distinct flavor and aroma to the dish.

How to make Hakka Noodles
Preparation and cooking noodles

1. First finely chop all the veggies and keep aside. You can even shred or grate the veggies using a food processor. I have used carrots, french beans, spring onions, button mushrooms, capsicum and cabbage 
2. Boil enough water in a pot or pan with some salt and a few drops of oil.
3. Add the hakka noodles (200 grams).
4. Cook the hakka noodles according to the package instructions. The noodles have to be cooked till al dente or just about cooked.
5. Drain cooked noodles in a colander. Then rinse noodles with fresh water very well. This stops the cooking process and removes the starch.6.
Add ½ tablespoon toasted sesame oil.
7. Toss noodles well, so that the oil gets coated evenly on them. This gets rid of stickiness from them.
8. Heat 2 tablespoons sunflower oil (or any neutral tasting oil) in a frying pan or wok. On a medium-low to medium heat, first sauté the red chilies and garlic for about a minute.
9. Increase the heat a bit and then add the 3 to 4 small spring onions (finely chopped), 8 to 10 french beans (finely chopped). Stir fry for about 3 minutes.

Pro Tip: For non-stick frying pans, keep the heat to medium and for cast iron or carbon steel pans or wok, use medium-high to high heat10. Add the 4 to 5 button mushrooms (finely chopped), 1 small to medium carrot (finely chopped) and 1 teaspoon finely chopped celery and continue stir-frying.

You can also add ½ cup finely chopped cabbage and 1 small to medium capsicum at this step. For the hakka noodles video in the post, cabbage is added.
11. Stir fry for about 5 to 6 minutes till the edges of the veggies start to slightly brown. I like the veggies to be cooked more, than what is the norm usually for this recipe. You can cut down on the stir frying time, if you prefer half cooked or more crunchy veggies.
12. Add ½ tablespoon soy sauce and mix well.
13. Add the cooked noodles. Mix, keep on tossing and stir-fry noodles for 1 to 2 minutes.
14. Season with salt and crushed black pepper as per taste. Add ¼ teaspoon rice vinegar or white vinegar or rice wine.
15. Toss well again and stir fry for a minute. Switch off the flame and add 1 to 2 tablespoons spring onion greens and mix well. Or you can garnish with spring onions while serving.
16. Serve Hakka Noodles as it is or accompanied with an Indo Chinese dish like gobi manchurian or paneer manchurian or chilly mushroom or mushroom manchurian.
